%% Problem 1
\problem{}

	Prove that the class of Turing-acceptable languages is closed under union, intersection, and reversal.
	For each property, give a detailed \underline{sketch} of the proof, by saying how you would
	build a Turing machine that accepts the resulting language, given the Turing machine(s) that
	accept the original language(s).

\solution

	\textbf{Union} \\
	\begin{proof}
		Let $L_1, L_2$ be Turing-acceptable languages, then define their corresponding 
		Turing machines as $M_1, M_2$ respectively.

		We will then define a new machine $M_U$ which operates on the union of
		$Q,\Sigma$ for $M_1, M_2$. We will distinguish each state by the source machine,
		thus $Q_1 \cap Q_2 = \emptyset$. The initial state of $M_U$ will be the initial
		state of $M_1$.
		
		On the input of a string $w$, $M_U$ will behave exactly as $M_1$. If 
		we reach a halting and accepting state of $M_1$, then $M_U$ will also halt and accept.
		Otherwise, rather than halting and accepting, $M_U$ will then run $M_2$ on $w$, 
		once $M_2$ halts, $M_U$ accepts if $M_2$ does, and rejects otherwise.
		Note that $M_I$ will halt provided that both $M_1$ and $M_2$ each halt.

		Now assume $w\in L_1\cup L_2$, then either $w\in L_1$ or $w\in L_2$, if $w\in L_1$
		$w$ will be accepted by $M_U$ after the initial run of $M_1$ (as $M_1$ accepts $w$).
		Otherwise if $w\in L_2$, then after $M_U$ runs $M_1$ where $M_1$ rejects $w$,
		$M_U$ will continue with $M_2$ which accepts $w$ and thus so does $M_U$.
		If $w\not\in L_1\cup L_2$ then $w\notin L_1$ thus $M_U$ continues onto $M_2$,
		but as $w\not\in L_2$, $L_2$ will reject $w$ and thus so will $M_U$.

	\end{proof}

	\bigbreak
	\textbf{Intersection} \\
	\begin{proof}
		Let $L_1, L_2$ be Turing-acceptable languages, then define their corresponding 
		Turing machines as $M_1, M_2$ respectively.

		We will then define a new machine $M_I$ which operates on the union of
		$Q,\Sigma$ for $M_1, M_2$. We will distinguish each state by the source machine,
		thus $Q_1 \cap Q_2 = \emptyset$. The initial state of $M_U$ will be the initial
		state of $M_1$.

		On the input of a string $w$, $M_I$ will behave exactly as $M_1$. If we reach
		a halting and rejecting state of $M_1$, then $M_I$ will halt and reject, if $M_1$
		halts and accepts, $M_I$ will continue on and run $M_2$ on $w$. If $M_2$ accepts
		$w$, then so will $M_I$ otherwise $w$ is rejected by $M_I$.
		Note that $M_I$ will halt provided that both $M_1$ and $M_2$ each halt.

		Now assume $w\in L_1\cap L_2$, then $w\in L_1$ and $w\in L_2$, because of this,
		$w$ will run through both stages of $M_I$ and pass each, thus $M_I$ clearly accepts $w$.
		However, if $w\not\in L_1\cap L_2$, then $w\not\in L_1$ (in which case
		$w$ is rejected in the first stage of $M_I$) or $w\not\in L_2$ (in which case
		$w$ is rejected by the second stage of $M_I$). In either case, $w$ will be rejected
		by $M_I$, therefore $M_I$ represents $L_1\cap L_2$.
	\end{proof}

	\bigbreak
	\textbf{Reversal} \\
	\begin{proof}
		Let $L$ be a Turing-acceptable language, then define a corresponding Turing machine $M$
		which. Define a new Turing machine $M_R$ using the same alphabet, and set of states as $M$.
		However let the initial state of $M_R$ be the final accepting state of $M$, similarly, let
		the final state of $M_R$ be the initial state of $M$.

		We can then run $M$ backwards on $w$ (note we are starting on the final state), if we
		can then reach the initial state of $M$ we have successfully read the reverse of a string
		$w\in L$, thus the initial state of $M$ will be the final accepting state of $M_R$. If 
		running $M$ backwards halts but does not accept, then $M_R$ should reject the input.
		In this sense, the $\delta$ function of $M_R$ is the inverse of the $\delta$ function for $M$.

		To show this accepts reversal, assume $w\in L$ then $M$ accepts $w$ and $w^R\in L^R$.
		Running $M_R$ on $w^R$ is equivalent to running $w$ on $M$, which accepts $w$ thus $M_R$
		accepts $w^R$. If $w\not\in L$ then $M$ does not accept $w$, thus $w^R\not\in L^R$.
		Running $M^R$ on $w^R$ is again equivalent to running $w$ on $M$, however as $w\not\in L$,
		we know that $M$ will not reach an accepting state, therefore running $\delta$ backwards from
		the accepting state cannot possibly reach the initial state (the final accepting state of $M^R$)
		therefore $M^R$ will not accept $w^R$.
	\end{proof}

%% Problem 2
\problem{}

	Prove or disprove that the set of Turing-acceptable languages is closed under concatenation.

\solution

	\begin{proof}

	\end{proof}

%% Problem 3
\problem{}

	Consider a new type of \textit{deterministic} machine, having one read-only input tape
	and two stacks. The tap is read-only, it cannot be written, but the head can move left, right,
	or do nothing. Each stack operates, independently of the other, as in a deterministic pushdown
	automaton:
	$$
		M = (K,\Sigma, \Gamma_1, \Gamma_2, z_1, z_2, \delta, s)
	$$
	where $K$ is a finite set of states, $\Sigma$ is a finite input alphabet,
	$\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ are two finite stack alphabets, $z_1\in \Gamma_1$ and $z_2\in \Gamma_2$
	are the initial symbols for the two stacks, $s\in K$ is the initial state. $h$ is a special
	halting state not in $K$, just like a Turing machine.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Give an appropriate definition for the transition function $\delta$, for a 
			configuration of this machine, for the ``yields in one step" operator,
			and for the language accepted by this machine.
		\item These machines can accept the same languages as a class of automata you already know:
			deterministic pushdown automata, pushdown automata, or Turing machines? Prove
			your answer formally.
	\end{enumerate}
