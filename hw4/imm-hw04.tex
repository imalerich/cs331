%% Problem 1
\problem{}

	Use the pumping lemma to prove that 
	$L = \{ww : w \in \{0,1\}*\}$ is not regular.

\solution

	\begin{proof} via contradiction \\
		Assume that L is regular, that is, the pumping lemma holds on L.
		First, note that L is clearly infinite, thus the pumping lemma
		will not vacuously hold. 
		\bigbreak
		Let $p \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ such that the pumping lemma holds by our assumption on $p$. \\
		Now define $w$ such that $|w| = 4p$ and \\
		\begin{addmargin}[1em]{}
			$w_i = 0 \text{ for } 0\leq i<p$, \\
			$w_i = 1 \text{ for } p\leq i<2p$, \\
			$w_i = 0 \text{ for } 2p\leq i<3p$, \\
			$w_i = 1 \text{ for } 3p\leq i<4p$
		\end{addmargin}
		Note that $w\in L$. \\
		Then, by the pumping lemma we must have that $w = xyz$ where
		$(1)\ |y| \geq 1 \wedge(2)\ |xy| \leq p \wedge(3)\ xy^nz \in L\  \forall n\geq 0$. \\
		Note that by construction of $w$, $xy$ will be a sequence of repeated $0$'s, as 
		$|xy| \leq p$ and $\forall\ 0\leqi<p, w_i = 0$.
		\bigbreak
		Now consider $xy^nz \text{ where } n\geq 0$. By assumption, we have that
		$xy^0z \in L$, that is $xz \in L$, where $xy = 0^k1^p0^p1^p$, for some $0\leq k<p$ 
		(as we have removed at least 1 zero by removing $y$). Assume $w = vv, v\in \{0,1\}^*$
		by definition of $L$,  then $|v| = \frac{3p + k}{2}$. \\
		% then $p+k < |v| = \frac{3p + k}{2} < 2p$. \\
		$|v| = &\frac{3p+k}{2} = 1.5p + 0.5k,\text{ then } p<k\Rightarrow 0.5p<0.5k\Rightarrow$
		$&p + k < 1.5p + 0.5k = |v|$\\ 
		further $|v| = 1.5p + 0.5k < 2p$
		\bigbreak
		Thus we have, $p + k < |v| < 2p$. That is to say, $v$ splits our string somewhere
		in the first group of $1$'s.
		Then $v = 0^k1^p0^m = 0^n1^p$, where $m,n \in \mathbb{Z}^+, m+n = p$. \\
		However, $0^k1^p0^m$ clearly ends in $0$ where $0^n1^p$ clearly ends in $1\Rightarrow
		v \neq v$.
		This is a contradiction, the pumping lemma fails, and this language must
		be nonregular.
	\end{proof}
